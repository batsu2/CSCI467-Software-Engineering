# CSCI467-Software-Engineering
This holds the project I completed with a group of my peers in my Software Engineering class consisting of HTML, CSS, PHP, authorizing credit card information with a RESTful API, and integrating a legacy SQL database with the SQL database we developed. The project serves as a landing and management pages for a business operating an online storefront.
